# (Optional) Dictionary API

Remember the dictionary API we used in [Continuous Integration exercise](../../02-Best-Practices/04-Countinuous-Integration)? The source code of this Ruby on Rails application is available here:

:point_right: [github.com/lewagon/dictionary-api](https://github.com/lewagon/dictionary-api)

## Exercise

Use the GitHub flow and all the knowledge you now have on Flask & REST to **replicate** this API in Python.
